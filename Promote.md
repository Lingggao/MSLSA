​    Students from institutions of higher learning are usually inclined to spend more time on exploring academic issues. They can hardly be attracted by those activities unrelated to what they are studying. To win their attention to our activity, we may consider offering some gifts to the participants. No student resents gifts. The gits can be diversified. They can make physical ones like cups, fans, key chains, or even drinks and snacks printed with our Logo, and they can also be virtual ones such as the secret key of Microsoft 365.

​    Besides, compared with posters composed of black letters and white background only, posters containing both briefing letters and colorful pictures will be preferred by more students. Therefore, we may produce some propaganda posters with beautiful colors and legible letters to attract more students to our activity. In addition to the transmission through social media, physical posters placed along the paths where students have to pass in attending and leaving their classes can inform more students about the activity we are going to hold.

​    Finally, the theme of the activity must fit the practice. For example, "Track wild polar bear with AI technique" appears more suitable than "Theoretical Basics of Artificial Intelligence" for an activity. The host and speech-maker of the activity should be decently dressed, appear confident in delivering a speech, and impart their professional knowledge to the participants as much as possible. Upon the end of the activity, we should humbly listen to participants' opinions and suggestions so that necessary adjustments may be made in the next activity.

​        通常情况下，高校学生会花费较长的时间来研究学术。如果我们举办的活动与其所学的专业并不相关的话，学生们一般不会很感兴趣。为了吸引学生们参与我们的活动，首先可以考虑向参与者赠送一些礼物 —— 显然，没有任何学生会讨厌可以免费获得的礼物。礼物可以是多样化的，可以是实体，例如印有活动 Logo 的水杯、风扇、钥匙扣等等，甚至饮料和零食；也可以是虚拟礼物，例如 Microsoft 365 产品密钥等。

​        其次，相比于白纸黑字的活动介绍，大多数的学生更喜欢图文并茂的宣传图片。因此，为了吸引更多的学生们参与活动，我们应当制作色彩美观、文字清晰的宣传海报。除了通过社交媒体传播以外，还要在学生们上下课的必经之路放置实体海报，这样可以让更多的人知悉我们所举办的活动。

​        最后，活动的主题应当切合实践。例如，“使用 AI 跟踪野生北极熊” 明显比 “人工智能理论基础” 更加适合作为活动的主题。活动的主持人与演讲者应当衣着得体、谈吐大方，向参与者毫无保留的传授自己的专业知识。活动结束后，我们必须谦虚的听取参与者们所提出的意见建议，并在下一次举办活动时进行必要的调整。
