​    Compared with students not in the field of computer science, I am closer to cutting-edge international technologies as an information engineering major in an institution of higher learning in China. The immortal honor of science and technology lies in its helping effect on the soul of human beings to remove their sense of insecurity before the natural world. I have personally witnessed many high technologies and deeply felt the tininess of human beings in front of the immense universe. To get rid of being tiny and helpless, human beings must insist on developing science and technology without any doubt. Students in higher learning institutions around the world are reserves backing the development of global science and technology. Since I’m lucky enough to be standing at the cusp of the age, I should devote all myself to the technology that I truly love. This is what a young student is obliged to do. It’s also the root cause of my eternal excitement about the cutting-edge technologies.

​    Second of all, why should I help other students in exploring and investigating the technologies? The reason is quite simple, too. As an individual, human beings are tiny. Although some scientific giants have made indelible contributions to the world, they constitute only a minority. The countless ordinary scientific and technical workers, scholars, and researchers are the real promoting force for technological development. Einstein once said: “If I give you a pfennig, you will be one pfennig richer and I’ll be poorer. But if I give you an idea, you will have a new idea, but I shall still have it.” Maybe I’m doomed to be a typical scientific researcher instead of an academic giant. However, if I can do whatever I can to help other students explore and study new technologies, I will virtually help cultivate more scientific and technical workers for the world. I believe this will bring in better effect and contribute more to the scientific and technological development of human society than being working all by oneself. This is also the goal of my constant efforts.

​        相比于其他非计算机科学领域的学生们来说，我身为中国高等院校信息工程专业的一名学生，自然是更加接近世界前沿科学技术的。科学技术的不朽荣誉，在于它通过对人类心灵的作用，克服了人类在自然界面前的不安全感。我亲眼所见了很多伟大的技术，深知人类相对于宇宙的渺小。人类若想摆脱渺小，走向伟大，就必须坚定不移的发展科学技术。世界各国的高校学生都是促进全球科技水平发展的后备军，我有幸站在了时代前沿，理所应当为自己所热爱的技术奉献一切。这是一个青年学生的应尽责任，也是我对前沿技术永远保持兴奋的根本原因。

​        其次，我为什么要帮助其他学生探索和学习技术呢？原因也很简单 —— 人类个体是渺小的。很多学术巨匠为世界做出了不可磨灭的贡献，但他们毕竟只是少数。无数平凡的科技工作者、学者、研究人员，才是推动技术发展的重要力量。爱因斯坦曾经说过，“如果我给你一个芬尼，你富裕了一芬尼，而我少了一芬尼；然而我给你一个想法，你多了新的想法，而我却并没损失”。我或许难以成为一代学术巨匠，但是如果我可以尽其所能的来帮助其他学生探索与学习新技术，则相当于在无形之中为世界培养了更多的科技工作者。相比于单枪匹马，我认为这可以带来更好的效果，也一定可以为人类社会的科学技术发展做出更大的贡献 —— 这也是我的最终奋斗目标。
