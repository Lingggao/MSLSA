# Teach

​    To pass technological concepts to a friend who knows nothing about them is a tough task. In this process, one thing is essential: don’t employ “forcing” means. Everyone has distinct interests and hobbies. We may consider starting from where the friend’s real interests lie and whether the technology can be directly or indirectly applied to one of his attention. Then, we may use the technology to draft a simple demonstration system and impart it through “learning by doing.” This method may yield a better effect.

​    In 2019, I once tried to introduce Microsoft Power Apps to one of my classmates. To bring him to be enchanted by the technology, I wrote a simple code application concerning rabbiting feeding techniques with Power Apps. He was a great fan of rabbits and was feeding two cute greys Angora rabbits right then in his dorm. As I expected, he became amazed by the application I wrote for him, and proactively asked me to teach him how to use the Power Apps. Now, he has utilized the Power Apps in completing several interesting apps at low code quantity. Even if he is neither a student who majored in computer science nor has similar coding experience, he has benefited a lot from the fantastic technology Microsoft Power Apps.

​        将技术概念传授给一个从未对此有过了解的朋友，这是一项非常艰巨的工作。有一点非常重要，那就是不要使用 “强迫” 式的传授手段。每个人都有与众不同的兴趣爱好，我们可以考虑从朋友的兴趣爱好入手，想一想这个技术是否可以直接或间接的应用于某个兴趣爱好。然后，我们可以使用这个技术来做一个小的演示系统，利用 “做中学” 的方式进行传授，这样的效果是最好的。

​        2019 年，我曾试图向一位同学介绍 Microsoft Power Apps 技术。为了让他可以对这个技术充满兴趣，我使用 Power Apps 编写了一个有关兔子饲养技巧的低代码应用 —— 他非常热爱兔子，并且在寝室养了两只灰色的安哥拉兔，十分可爱。果不其然，他非常喜欢我为他编写的应用，并且主动请求我为他详细介绍 Power Apps 的使用方法。目前，他已经利用 Power Apps 以低代码量编写了不少有趣的应用。即使他并不是计算机科学专业的学生，也没有相应的编码经验，他仍然通过 Microsoft Power Apps 这个神奇的技术受益匪浅。
